"""The most cost-effective legal build for every ToW / Custom army.

"Value" is normative: what the game's average pricing rule would charge for a
card's stats in a reference army. That is the per-class model V4 at corps number
8, imperial/coalition at the reference, and no army × unit-class adjustment.
Commander cards are valued by the commander model (given the true regular price)
applied to their unit's normative value, also at corps 8. A card whose actual
price is below its value gives more stats per gold than the game's own average
rule; a build's value ÷ cost is its cost-effectiveness.

For each army an integer programme maximises total value under the game's limits
for Theatre-of-War and Custom armies (tools/army_builder_rules.py; no brigade or
division discounts outside Army Corps):

- exactly one staff general and at most one combat general (commander card), as
  the user specified (October 2026). The staff general is valued by the global
  general price rule T3 at corps 8 (76.55·stars^1.39, 1 without stars; no army
  modifier) plus a hand-set command correction (see M_REF / COMMAND_LAMBDA below:
  stars count for more in large, low-morale builds; C-class generals get a small
  nudge and a priced melee bonus), and chosen by the optimiser among all the
  army's staff generals — except in the "top staff" build, which takes the
  highest-star one, valued by T3 alone;
- 31 cards in total *including* the staff general, i.e. at most 30 units, as the
  app counts it (web/src/state/build.ts expandBuild puts the staff-slot card into
  the list that checkKnownLimits caps at MAX_TOTAL_UNIT_CARDS = 31; the game's
  Lua only states NTW3.MaxUnits() = 31). The app also lets a combat general take
  the staff slot; these builds always use a staff general there;
- 10 000 funds;
- foot artillery ≤ 2, horse artillery ≤ 1 (2 for a cavalry-only corps), heavy
  cavalry ≤ 10; a commander counts as its unit's class;
- each unit's `unit_cap`, shared by its commander versions;
- at most one general per unit;
- build 4 only ("four corps"): units from at most 4 source corps, as one
  Theatre-of-War roll offers (NTW3AC.ToWFarmycorps, max_ac = 4). A unit's source
  corps is the 4th part of its key (web/src/domain/tow.ts towSourceCorpsIdOf); the
  staff general's corps counts too, so the optimiser chooses the staff general
  jointly. Custom armies have no source corps and are unaffected.

Two builds per army:
- **max value:** no composition rule;
- **balanced:** at least 4 cavalry cards and 2 artillery cards, where the army
  has them.

**Size-harmonised values.** V4's errors depend on unit size (it overprices small
and very large units and is much noisier there), so before optimising, each
unit's value is corrected by a reference-batch ComBat harmonisation across size
strata (harmonise_by_size; report §5). Two versions: full (each size stratum's
bias and excess noise removed) and noise-only (only the noise removed; the
replays link the systematic size discount to winning). Units above 240 models
take part and are flagged; both pricing models overprice them by ~25–70%
(PRICING_MODEL_REPORT.md §5).

**Not checked:** a ToW army's roll. Its units come from several source corps on
a rotation, so a build may need a specific time window (the app's "Generate
times" finds it).

Inputs: committed outputs, analysis/commander_model_coefficients.csv, the
class_structure checkpoints. Outputs: analysis/output/cost_effective_builds.md
and cost_effective_builds.csv (full size harmonisation), and the same with the
suffix _noise_only (noise-only harmonisation).

# Command correction for builds 1, 2 and 4 (hand-set, October 2026). The price rule T3 charges
# a staff general for his stars only, but the user's game experience is that command stars
# matter more in a large, low-morale army (more units close to routing, more models to rally),
# and that a C-class (cavalry-speed) general is worth more than a standard one of the same
# stars: he reaches more of the line, and some have a fighting bodyguard. Neither is priced:
# C-class generals cost what T3 predicts from their stars (ratio 0.93–1.00). The replays did not
# show the deficit effect once player skill was controlled (output/general_command_report.md);
# the user's view is that the replays are biased (weak players don't bring big armies, strong
# players keep big armies from routing even under a low-star general), so it is set by hand:
#
#   general value = (T3(stars) + λ·stars·D) · (1 + σ·[C class]) + melee bodyguard bonus,
#   D = Σ over the build's units of models · (M_REF − morale)₊     (the morale deficit)
#
# Calibration anchors, given by the user: in [1806] 10. Preußen the 2★ general (Kalckreuth)
# must be better value per gold than any unit in his build, and in [1815] 6. Napoli the
# optimiser must almost always take Murat (5★, C4). `python analysis/cost_effective_builds.py
# --calibrate` finds, per valuation, the smallest λ for the first and checks the second, which
# that λ already meets; λ is that minimum rounded up to the next 0.0005 for margin. The anchor
# depends on the unit values (Kalckreuth must beat the army's best unit per gold), hence one λ
# per size version (COMMAND_LAMBDA). σ is only a nudge, as the user asked: at
# equal stars (equal price within an army) take the C-class general — C1, C2 and C4 included,
# which have no combat stats. Trading stars for speed is left for later; σ may need adjusting.
# The melee bonus is not hand-set: it is the cavalry model's price for a 16-model bodyguard with
# the C3 combat stats minus with the standard general's (bodyguard_melee_bonus).

# (200–240, ×1.34; >240, ×1.31) and underprices the mid-sized bulk (100–120, ×0.97), because one
# size power per class cannot follow the game's price curve and the fit is anchored on the
# ~2 600 mid-sized units. It is also noisier at the extremes (80% range 0.95–1.56 at 200–240
# vs 0.91–1.01 at 100–120). Unharmonised, the optimiser read that misfit as bargains and almost
# never picked mid-sized infantry. A spline refit would absorb the size effect entirely; the
# user wants to still see whether extreme sizes are better value, so instead the errors are
# harmonised across size strata as batch effects, ComBat-style (Johnson, Li & Rabinovic 2007,
# reference-batch variant): each stratum's mean error (bias) and spread (reliability) are
