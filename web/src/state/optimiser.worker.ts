// Web Worker for the build optimiser: runs HiGHS (WebAssembly) off the main thread,

// answers with the solution (state/solveLp.ts workerSolver is the client).
//
// The .wasm is imported as a URL so Vite fingerprints it and the PWA precaches it
// (vite.config.ts globPatterns "**/*.wasm"); the Electron app:// scheme serves it as
// application/wasm (electron/main.cjs MIME map).
